* Simple touch and do something loop
* Works on android
* "Stuh" refers to star

Plan to refine the gameplay:

    * Mechanics: what happens when star is touched? sound, visual
    * Goals: What motivates to play, and sense of achievement
    * Rewards:
    * Decision
    * Context: What do I want to child to imagine. Immersion, presence
