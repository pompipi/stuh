# A hobby project to create a game for my toddler

Also to learn game development and Godot.

* Simple touch and do something loop
* Works on android
* "Stuh" refers to star

Plan to refine the gameplay:

* Purpose
* Mechanics: what happens when star is touched? sound, visual
* Goals: What motivates to play, and sense of achievement
* Rewards:
* Decision
* Context: What do I want to child to imagine. Immersion, presence

To build:

* Godot 3.2.3. Default settings will do.
* Export to Android. Again default setup will do.
* See the README in /asset/sound. You will need to download your own sound files. License restrictions mean I can't include them here. It will still compile without sound files though.
